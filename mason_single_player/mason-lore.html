  	<p>It's our understanding that foreign fungal spores inhabiting an astroid fell to earth and reawoke nature. The spores seemed to enhanced every plant it came into contact with. Photosynthesis efficiencies were at levels never before seen. Nature was suddenly improving upon itself. The trees grew faster and taller. Their bark grew thicker as well. It was only a matter of time before nature started to encroach on humanity.</p>
    <p>In a matter of weeks, entire cities were getting swallowed by the ever growing forests. The woods became as wild as the animals. New species of flora and fauna seemed to appear overnight. The earth became unrecognizable from what it once was. There is a lot to learn about the new world. New types of medicines and food can be discovered right in your backyard. Around that time new materials and technologies designed to tame this new world started to get worked on.</p>
    <p>Specially designed robots with mighty tools and weapons were created to reclaim the cities of old. That made nature angry. The more the trees and vines were cut the more nature seemed to bite back. Some strange new diurnal and nocturnal predators started appearing. Man seemed to be the target. Humanity suddenly had it's back against the wall. What was left of the world powers of old united mankind to come together to reclaim the planet. World peace was achieved and the smartest and brightest around the world were all united under the goal to protect humanity. For the first time, the forest could be stopped.</p>
    <p>There was a new renaissance of art, science and technology. Artificial intelligence was said to be rediscovered. Air could have weight and light could be solid. Man became bold once again. New robots were created to claim the new world. Other robots were designed to rebuild civilization. For the first time in a long time, large stretches of land could be cleared for the exploding human population. Man became so bold that they thought they could control nature once again.</p>
    <p>New chemicals and techniques were developed to reduce the efficiency of the plants to grow and reproduce. In a controlled setting, most plants were said to grow like they once did. The land around the new cities were sprayed with these chemicals to help keep the ever growing forest at bay. Over several generations, it was observed that some of the animals that existed around the plants with treated soil were behaving differently. Cases of wild attacks were reported. The rabid animals studied had millions of unique fungal spores on their fur and in their lungs. It was as though the earth had awoken once again. Panic and fear gripped the hearts of many. No one could agree on a solution to the new fungal growth. It was as if all of nature had declared war on mankind.</p>
    <p>More and more decisions by the world leaders were made out of haste and fear. Faith in the new government started to wane. News slowly became propaganda. Reliable information and freedoms once enjoyed by the world eventually became illegal. A civil war broke out and the end result was self annihilation. One by one the new world cities sank into the earth. Nature violently claimed the land once again. What was left of mankind evacuated the cities and are now living in the jungles of the new world. Civilization as we knew it is over. I fear many of the worlds ideals and technologies are slowly being forgotten. World history is becoming a distant memory.</p>

	<p><b>Voice:</b> I don't know how we didn't see this coming. We ignored the warnings. We let history repeat itself.</p>
	<p>*Phi Entertainment Presents...*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show a forest. Camera is panning over to a city entangled in a forest. Stop panning when the city is centered.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> I don’t know how, but this planet is alive. I know it for sure now.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Keep the city centered in the forest.</u></i>
	<p>*MASON*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the city in the forest sink into the earth.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> Let me start from the beginning. Somehow, someway I was spared from the destruction. There was no warning when our city sank into the earth. I’ve never seen anything like it before. Luckily I made it out with a few items on me. I could only hope others made it out as well.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the main game menu with just the camp made.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> When things quieted down, I made camp next to the ruins of the old city. The first thing I built was a shelter. It wasn’t much but it was home.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show a computer box and then show it turn on.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> I was fortunate enough to find a mostly in tact computer buried under some scrap. After some tinkering, I managed to get the Geo Navigator and the Data Network Adapter to operate again. When those lights turned on, it was a relief you couldn’t imagine in the face of what happened.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the main game menu with just the camp made.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> I needed to check out the Geo Navigator to see if I could spot any survivors. *Tap on your home base* *Now tap on the map*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Display a map with a red “blip” at the top.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> I couldn’t believe it, a signal was found! The problem was, it was too weak to connect to. My computers receiver needed a boost but I didn’t know how to increase it. *Tap the back button*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Display the inside of your base. The upgrade machine is a helmet connected to the network. Selling items are on a computer.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> I had to upgrade my engineering ability but that information won’t come cheap. I connected my old Neural Matrix helmet to the Alexandria Information Exchange Network and managed to find a working server. Now I could see how much it will cost.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Display the upgrade menu and disable all the other upgrade selections.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> Fortunately it wasn’t too expensive. I needed to see what I can find to generate these funds. *Tap the back button*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Display the inside of your base.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> I sat down at the computer and searched through what was left of the Global Network for any working sites. After some time, I came across The Grand Exchange Network. Most of the links on the site were dead but I found one where I could input scrap metal or robotic parts and get funds as a result. I don’t know if anyone was operating that server anymore but it made me think that civilization wasn’t as far gone as I previously thought it was. It was time to go outside and see what I could find. *Tap the back button*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the main game menu.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> If the New World was full of anything it was scrap metal from the cataclysm. I should be able to get everything I need right here. *Tap the scrap heap to find scrap* *You can sell your scrap at the computer*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the sell menu.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> Now that I had enough funds, it was time to upgrade my engineering ability. *Tap on your helmet to bring up the upgrades*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the upgrade menu.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> Now that I understood how to increase the range of my computers receiver, I promptly made the adjustments I needed with some extra scrap I had around. It was time that I took a look at the map again. *Tap the back button*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Display a map with a red “blip” at the top.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> I was pleased to see that red blip was still transmitting!  I connected to the signal and attempted to make contact. All I could make out was mostly static, but occasionally I’d here this tone buried in the static. I attempted to tune the receiver but no luck. I will have to go and upgrade my computer again. *Tap the back button*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Display the inside of your base.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> I could remember that the next engineering upgrade was a little expensive. It would make more sense to research a workshop so that I could sell robotic parts. The parts would sell for more and I wouldn’t have to be outside all day. I could remember from my studies how to make some basic parts for a Robotic Defender. I’m really glad I pushed myself back then to take that course! Let’s put the Neural Matrix helmet back on and figure out how to build a workshop. *Tap on the helmet and learn how to make a workshop*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the upgrade menu.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> Now that I know how to make a workshop, I promptly got started putting one together. I started with a hammer. Making the hammer was tricky  without other tools to help you. Once that was done, the rest of project came together quickly. *Tap the back button and go outside*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the main game menu.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> The workshop turned out better that I expected. I had all the tools I needed to start cobbling together some parts. Before I can make anything, I’ll need some more scrap… *Gather some scrap and make any part you wish to sell* *different parts cost different types of scrap and have their own strengths*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the sell menu.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> Now that I had enough funds, it was time to upgrade my engineering ability. *Tap the back button and put on your Neural Matrix helmet to upgrade*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the upgrade menu.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> I understood now why I couldn’t make out the transmission from the signal on the map before. It was an old video broadcasting format. Perhaps with a rectifier I could decode the signal. *Tap the back button and open the map*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Display a map with a red “blip” at the top.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> Just as I thought, it worked! Now I could make out the transmission.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: On a computer screen, the video results are scrambled. *Sound is a little gargled*.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> In the Common language I could make out a voice. “Come back to the source.” The messaged seemed to be on a loop, it kept repeating itself. At that moment it became clear that I had to get over there to find the source of this transmission. It would be dangerous to venture into the forest myself so I’ll have to make some Defenders to clear the way. Based on how far that signal is, I’ll have to upgrade the computers transmitter so the robots can be guided all the way there. I’ll also have to make some upgrades to the workshop if I’m going to start putting together Robotic Defenders. *Upgrade your engineering ability* *Upgrade your workshop (workshop upgrade requires engineering first)*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the upgrade menu.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> Time to upgrade my computer with a better transmitter. When that was done I looked and see if the Grand Exchange Network had an input for full Robot Defenders. To my surprise, they did but the prices were not great. I bet I could convince the Network Bots to give me a better price with a little practice.  *Go to the workshop and build a robot* </p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show build robot menu. After building a robot.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> I was very excited to put together my first robot. Those engineering upgrades really came through. Unfortunately, unless I was OK with my robots only being able to venture a few hundred kilometers I would have to add more power to my computers transmitter. I could sell a few robots to get more funds for more upgrades but eventually I’d have to send one out into the jungle to find another power source. Reactor Crystals are pretty common, I bet a robot could find a few near by. *Go to the map and send one or more robots on a mission*</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the main game menu. The first robot(s) are walking to the edge.</u></i>
	<p><b>Voice:</b> Good luck out there… While I waited for those crystals, I saw in the upgrades that Robot Arenas are still a thing. Once I built one, It was pretty fun to compete for prizes across the Network.</p>

	<p><b>Attendant:</b> Unfortunately, business isn’t like it once was. No one stops here anymore. Everyday it seems to get a little worse.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the customer.</u></i>
	<p><b>Customer:</b> Have you tried upgrading your sign? I hear a better sign will attract more customers.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the attendant.</u></i>
	<p><b>Attendant:</b> I started there and got several upgrades for my sign. I’ve not seen any results and now I can’t pay my bills. To make matters worse I’ve read here that the Blue Stone Research Academy is conducting experiments in town.</p>

	<p><b>Attendant:</b> I know but it would make sense why everyone has left. Why have you stopped coming by as often, if you don’t mind me asking?</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the customer.</u></i>
	<p><b>Customer:</b> I had a job transfer to the Inner City and now I don’t get out here as often as I’d like to.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the attendant.</u></i>
	<p><b>Attendant:</b> The Inner City, that explains it. Congratulations on the transfer. I hear the Inner City has something for everyone. I’m also glad I wasn’t the one who scared you off. I worry about that sometimes... Anyway, what can I do for you?</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the customer.</u></i>
	<p><b>Customer:</b> I was looking to see if you had any tools for a Robotic Defender and some fuel if you have any?</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the customer and attendant behind the register.</u></i>
	<p><b>Attendant:</b> Now that you say it, I do have a few tools in the workshop. They were ordered by another customer but they never came by to pick them up. If I have what you’re looking for, you’re welcome to any of them.</p>

	<p><b>Assistant:</b> The soil was worse than what I was expecting. If your hypothesis is correct, we will have to completely rethink what we do for food.</p>
	<p><b>Botanist:</b> Life adapts. Life finds a way to survive. I tried to tell them we are dealing with sentience. The plants are defending themselves.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the assistant.</u></i>
	<p><b>Assistant:</b> Somehow the crops on the eastern fields are now laced with this new molecule as well. Only this time I’m not sure how it.. Unless it’s water-soluble?</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the assistant on their computer.</u></i>
	<p><b>Assistant:</b> Of course, it came with the rain. The problem is not the plants, it’s not the soil, it’s this.. chemical that’s causing a reaction in the soil. Sir we have to tell the board!</p>
	<i><u>-Image: The botanist and assistant are facing each other next to the botanist’s work table.</u></i>
	<p><b>Botanist:</b> I already tried to tell them. They want this seasons crop harvested and shipped to the city. They said as long as the northern and western fields are not infected, there isn’t anything to worry about.</p>

	<p><b>Botanist:</b> I don’t believe it’s too late. I’ve become aware of something recently. Nature is speaking to us. It’s communicating to us with sights, sounds and smells. This is going to sound crazy but I’ve decoded a message from the trees. We have to leave here soon. What will happen next will be out of our hands.</p>

	<i><u>-Image: Show the botanist.</u></i>
	<p><b>Botanist:</b> This is not my decision, it’s natures and we need to heed this warning. We will pick up where we left off once we make it out. I have a backup of our recent results already compiled. Leave behind what you can’t carry.</p>

	<i><u>-Image: Show the business person sitting at their desk leisurely.</u></i>
	<p><b>Business Person:</b> Do you really want to know? Since you’re new I’ll give you a hint. All you have to do is to talk to them as if they were your family. Build a relationship and before long the clients will find you. That’s how deals are won.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Colleague 2 walks up to Colleague 1. Next scene, show Colleague 2.</u></i>
	<p><b>Colleague 2:</b> There’s no secret, either you’re in this or you’re not. You have to believe in what you’re doing. If you believe it, others will as well. If you KEEP telling our clients to go to our competitors, they will go and you will not get a sale. It’s simple.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show Colleague 1.</u></i>
	<p><b>Colleague 1:</b> I’m torn. I treat every client like family. If I knew of a good deal would I not tell my family that? Things have gotten difficult recently, don’t you remember?</p>

	<p><b>Colleague 2:</b> I remember perfectly. I thought you were surprised why you haven’t made a sale yet?</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show Colleague 1.</u></i>
	<p><b>Colleague 1:</b> If I could make a deal without feeling like I’ve taken advantage of someone maybe I’d have a sale. To be fair, how many times have you two over embellished these living spaces? Just wait till they see these spaces for themselves.</p>
	<i><u>-Image: Show the business person sitting at their desk leisurely.</u></i>
	<p><b>Business Person:</b> It won’t matter what they see, they’ll take it. They’ll have to if they want some place to live. We all know most people can’t afford to own homes anymore. It’s only a matter of time. If they’re calling you, they have run out of options and have no where to go.</p>
